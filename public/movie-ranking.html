<h3>The Prestige</h3>
<p>Thrillers are my guilty pleasure and this one feeds right into it! 
And to add to the thrill is the magic as we all know-
the closer you, look the lesser you see.</p>
<p><b>Rating:</b> 5/5</p>

<h3>Megamind</h3>
<p>A must watch villian turned hero arc cartoon movie 
with a 1000 quotable lines</p>
<p><b>Rating:</b> 5/5</p>

<h3>500 days of Summer</h3>
<p>I'm not one for romcoms and this isn't even one no matter how much it might look like it.
A much needed tale of caution for the hopeless romantic loverboys and lover girls. </p>
